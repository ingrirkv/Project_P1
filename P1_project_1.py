Inflow_first_24h = 50   #[m^3/s], The inflow for the first 24 hours, given hourly
Inflow_Last_24h = 24*s  #[m^3/s], The inflow for the last 24 hours, given hourly. This includes uncertainty and a 0-index formulation. Example: For scenario 0, inflow is 10*0 = 0
N_Scenarios = 5         #[-], The number of scenarios for the second stage (last 24 hours)
p_scenario = 1/5        #[per unit],  The probability for each scenario.
Price = 50*t            #[EUR/MWh], The power prices for all 48 hours, given as a linearly increasing cost based on time step t. Assumes 0-index.Example: For hour 13 the cost is 50+13 = 63.
